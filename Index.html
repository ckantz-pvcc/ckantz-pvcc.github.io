        <h1>What is Bloatware?</h1>
        
	        <p>Have you ever run into the issue of having too little available space for a download on your hard drive, 
		but even after deleting everything you thought you could </p><p>live without, there still isn’t enough room?  This 
		is likely the effect of bloatware.  Bloatware is commonly identified as programs or code which artificially
		 inflate the</p><p> size of digital assets or take up unnecessary amounts of storage space, and require unnecessary 
		amounts of processing power.  </p>

	<h2>Types of Bloatware:</h2>

	        <p>The most commonly encountered forms of software bloat are manufacturer bloat, which comes pre-packaged 
		in your computer’s operating system.  That’s right, a </p><p>brand-new PC straight off the shelf is almost always
		packed full off programs put there by the manufacturer.  Typically, we want our computers to be able to </p><p>
		perform as many tasks as possible, and initially the presence of these programs can be a strong selling-point
		when a consumer makes a choice on a particular</p><p> machine.  However, these programs are often not needed, not 
		the preferred choice for someone interested in that particular function, or their existence may be </p><p>unknown 
		entirely!  So, another program is downloaded, creating redundancy.  In most cases both programs are automati
		cally updated over time, causing twice as</p><p> much space to be taken up as necessary. </p>
<h1></h1>
		<p>Sometimes a new machine will come with trialware installed.  This is paid software that comes preinstalled
		on a machine with a free trial period, and then prompts</p><p> the user to purchase a subscription to it when the 
		trial period is up.  Don’t
 		want the software?  It will stay on your computer until the software is uninstalled and the</p><p> files deleted.  
		These often take the form
 		of antivirus or security software, which paywall their services as a common practice.</p>
	       
<h1></h1>
		<p>There is also adware, which likewise comes pre-installed and only exists as a means to inject 
		advertisements and marketing algorithms
		 into a previously</p><p> ad-free interface.</p>
<h1></h1>
	  	<p>	Then there is software as a container, where a developer includes operating system files that allow
 		software to be optimized to
 		run as soon as the download is</p><p> finished.  This can be identified when a user downloads a program for a 
		seemingly simple task, only to discover that it 
		requires dozens more gigabytes of storage</p><p> than one would expect.  Containers came about as a means to skip 
		the software configuration process, in which 
		one must manually set up and manage</p><p> components, settings, and dependencies of a software system to ensure it
 		runs properly.  While this does give a more
 		user-friendly experience, it comes at a</p><p> massive cost to efficiency.</p>

	<h2>Why Does it Exist?</h2>

		<p>	As a concept, software bloat has been around for decades.  In 1995, Niklaus Wirth, chief designer of 
		several programming languages including 
		Pascal and</p><p> Oberon, published an article called “A Plea for Lean Software.”  In this article, he describes 
		the phenomenon of “uncontrolled software growth”
		and that it is made</p><p> possible by advancements in hardware capacity.  At the same time, it’s fueled by users’
 		collective desire for a plethora of features,
		but individual need of only a</p><p> few.</p>
<h1></h1>
		<p>	In the specific cases of manufacturer bloat, trialware, and adware, the origin is simple.  The 
		developers of this software pay the hardware 
		manufacturers to </p><p>preinstall the programs on new devices.  This is an attractive option to the manufacturer,
 		because hardware manufacturing is a low-margin 
		industry.  When offered </p><p>an extra ten or twenty dollars per sale at minimal cost, a manufacturer would be 
		hard-pressed to miss out on the opportunity. </p>
<h1></h1>
		<p>	Shipped containers are much more complex, however.  An easy but lazy way to describe the problem 
		would be to call it mediocre coding quality.  
		The reality is </p><p>that the framework modern software is built on, such as Electron JS, require the 
		incorporation of thousands of software packages, which in 
		turn are each </p><p>dependent on many thousands of helper packages.</p>

	<h2>Detriments and Dangers:</h2>

		<p>	The consequences of software bloat for the average end user can be summarized as artificial hardware 
		obsolescence.  Storage fills up, processing 
		speeds slow</p><p> down, and networks become choked with traffic even if no new functionalities are added.  While 
		not inherently catastrophic, it does mean that
		 the user must </p><p>continuously upgrade their systems, costing money and causing strife when the old systems 
		inevitably fail to handle the increasing workload
		 on aging hardware </p><p>over time.</p>
<h1></h1>
		<p>	For organizations requiring the use of software packaged in bloated containers, there are 
		significantly more dangerous factors in play.  When software
		 is affected</p><p> by shipped containers, there are potentially tens of millions of lines of unnecessary code for 
		hackers, malware users, and espionage agents to 
		hide malicious</p><p> code.  This bloat is referred to as "attack surface” and surveilling this is lamented as one
 		of the most difficult tasks in the cybersecurity 
		industry.  How long would it</p><p> take to find line 4,209,941 out of 10,472,054 and identify that as the one 
		that can damage your organization?  Is it possible to 
		find it before it deploys it's attack?</p><p>  Highly unlikely.</p>

	<h2>What do We do About it?</h2>

		<p>At the top of this page are links to resources that can help a user identify and remove bloat from their 
		device.  There are a multitude of options when it 
		comes to </p><p>cleaning up your computer’s operating system files, and most are free, reliable, and widely 
		available.</p>

		<p>I can’t offer as much help to organizations, but I must stress the importance of both good development 
		practices, as well as IT, cyber and data security.</p>
